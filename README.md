# Exitable Directory reader performance investigations

This repo contains some microbenchmarks that try to establish the cost of exitable directory reader vs the newer lucene API.

This is not yet rigorous. Full JMH style benchmarks will be a goal, but right now I'm exploring what codepaths I want to use and what outputs etc we want for analysis.
